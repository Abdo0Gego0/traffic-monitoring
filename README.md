AITMS is an innovative Traffic Management System incorporating YOLO v8 for real-time car detection and the Max Pressure Traffic Algorithm for intelligent signal timing adjustments. This system provides accurate traffic monitoring, behavior analysis, and dynamic congestion reduction at intersections.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Real-time Detection:** Utilize YOLO v8 for precise and fast car detection.
- **BOT-Tracking Algorithm:** Analyze vehicle behavior and detect violations with advanced tracking.
- **Max Pressure Traffic:** Dynamically optimize traffic signal timings based on vehicle density for reduced congestion.
