AITMS is an innovative Traffic Management System incorporating YOLO v8 for real-time car detection and the Max Pressure Traffic Algorithm for intelligent signal timing adjustments. This system provides accurate traffic monitoring, behavior analysis, and dynamic congestion reduction at intersections.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Real-time Detection:** Utilize YOLO v8 for precise and fast car detection.
- **BOT-Tracking Algorithm:** Analyze vehicle behavior and detect violations with advanced tracking.
- **Max Pressure Traffic:** Dynamically optimize traffic signal timings based on vehicle density for reduced congestion.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/traffic-eye.git
    cd traffic-eye
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üåê Usage

1. **Run the AITMS System:**

    ```bash
    python main_system.py
    ```

2. **Access the Monitoring Dashboard:**
